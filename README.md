## Project Description-

**Citi Bikes trip Analysis**â€™s project is based on New York Citi bikes trip data. Citi Bike is the USAâ€™s largest and privately operated public bicycle sharing program serving the New York City boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, as well as Jersey City, New Jersey, and Hoboken, New Jersey. The dataset used here for analyzing has been retrieved from Citi Bikeâ€™s website which contains real time data for the bicycle service.
