<h2><span style="font-family:Monaco;color:#003B70">1. Purpose</span></h2>
<h4><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#003B70"> 
This report analyses City Bike's data from New York city, for the month of January 2020. We have attempted to analyse the data from various perspectives such as Demography, Time-Series, Geography, etc. To do so, we have created visualizations by using different types of plots such as Leaflets, Network Diagrams, Line Graph, Bar Chart, Donut Graph, Scatter Plot and Pi Chart. Some of these visualizations are dynamic, helping the reader interact with data and fetch valuable insights from the same. Additionally, we have also provided our inferences and suggestions based on our comprehension about the data.</span></h4>

<h2><span style="font-family:Monaco;color:#003B70">2. Background</span></h2>
<h4><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#003B70">Citi Bike is the USA's largest and privately operated public bicycle sharing program serving the New York City boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, as well as Jersey City, New Jersey, and Hoboken, New Jersey. The dataset used here for analyzing has been retrieved from Citi Bike's website which contains real time data for the bicycle service.
</span></h2>
<h4><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#003B70">From this data, we are trying to inspect the data from different viewpoints and discover patterns and inferences from it. This report has touched upon various aspects of data and answers questions like; Who are the customers of Citi Bike?, How does factors such as Time, Weather and Day affect the sales? Which geographic location is more profitable than others?, How has business been doing for the past three years?, etc.
</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#003B70">Moreover, we have taken data from Jan 2020 to 2022 to understand the company's business during pre-pandemic, pademic and post-pandemic situation.</span></h4>

<p>&nbsp;<p>  
<p>&nbsp;<p>  

<h2><span style="font-family:Monaco;color:#003B70">3. Data Analysis</span></h2>
<h4><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#003B70"> The Data Analysis is done in four sections i.e. Demographic, Time-Series, Geographic and Year-Over-Year Analysis</span></h4>


<h3><span style="font-family:Monaco;color:#003B70">3.1. Demographic Analysis</span></h3>
<h4><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#003B70">To Analyse the demographical trends in data for Jan 2020, we have plotted the following graphs. The Pi chart shows consumer segments based on User Type i.e. Customers and Subscribers. Customers are one time users who can rent a Citi Bike from a rental location without a membership. Subscribers, as the name suggests, holds membership which can be annual, monthly or casual. The donut chart provides us a gender-based segregation of customers and subscribers. The stacked-bar graph provides an overview of customer based on their age-groups and gender.

<h4><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#003B70">The above visualizations clearly states that a major chunk of Citi Bike's Revenue is generated through subscriptions. Data provided on Citi Bike's website suggest revenue of approximately $0.97M for the month of Jan 2020 just through subscriptions. It can also be inferred that, 75% of the total users are male subscribers. R&D can be done and appropriate strategies can be established to promote Citi Bike's to Female Customers. Looking at the Bar plot, we can see that the users below the age of 20 are negligible. Citi Bikes can potentially look into the opportunity to invest into rental bikes for kids and young adults.</span></h4>

<h4><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#003B70">From the first graph it can be concluded that there is no significant co-relation between the day of the week and bikes used by subscribers. However, their is a considerable amount of increase in the number of bikes used by customers on weekends. Therefore, for the fraction of people who only uses Citi Bikes on weekends and do not have a yearly membership, a weekend pass would be a good idea to implement. The second line graph shows that females use less bikes as compared to men but the overall usage trend for both genders remain the same. The number of bikes used per day also varied with temperature. The third graph implies that whenever the temperature is low, bike usage for that day goes down as well.</span></h4>

Solutions can be provided to boost the usage of bikes at other times of the weekday without affecting the current peak usage times. Majority of people use bikes for 0-30 mins which will lead to more number of bikes being frequently available for customers. More schemes can be made by partnering with the government to boost tourism during the office hours which can generate more traffic during the office hours.</span></h4>

Research can be done to capitalize this demand by understanding user activity.

<h4><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#003B70">The graph shows an overall decrease in the number of Citi Bikes used in January 2022 over the previous years. This might be a result of the Covid-19 pandemic or the Climate Change over these years. The trend can be expected to change this year as the pandemic has subceeded.

<h2><span style="font-family:Monaco;color:#003B70">4. Conclusion</span></h2>
<h4><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;color:#003B70">The Citi Bike data examined and visualized in the above sections has helped us gain insights on the general trends and areas of improvements based on the inferences made after examining those trends. One of the major area of improvement can be understand why Citi Bikes are not being used by women - is the bike design one of the reason behind it? Another area of improvement is to introduce Citi Bikes for kids and young adults. Citi Bike can also look at different ideas to boost use of bikes for longer duration during office hours. Introduction of a weekend pass is another scheme that can be proposed to boost use of bikes on weekends. Increasing the number of docks at a station and introducing new stations can be considered as a viable option based on the geographical analysis conducted above. Lastly the year-on-year comparison shows a dip int the total no. of users in the recent years. Covid-19 could be one of the reasons but, detailed examination should be done to understand the root-cause as a preventive business measure.</span></h4>
